# Card_Memory_Game 
# Description
4 levels, Easy, Medium, Hard, and God.
The harder the levels get, more cards are added.
When the user clicks a card, the card flips up for 5 seconds and flips back down, then the user needs to flip another card and memorize the place of the cards they already flipped. 
When the user finds another card with the same image as one of the cards they found before, they click both cards.
They do this until they match all of the cards.
